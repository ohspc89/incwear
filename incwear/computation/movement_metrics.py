    recordlen : int

    # time_asleep calculated based on the original MATLAB code...
    # If 6000 consequent data points (5 min) show:
    #   1) angular velocity less than 0.3
    #   2) acceleration norm less than 1.001
    # then this period is considered as the baby sleeping or inactive.
    # Technically, this is a bit weird... because you would 'ignore'
    # movements with negative peaks. The second condition should be applied
    # to the absolute values of the detrended acc magnitudes.

    # For Axivity sensor recording, there are just too many data points.
    # This approach would not work.

    # Another method to calculate [time asleep] is introduced in
    # Trujillo-Priego et al. (2017) - less than 3 movements in 5 min.
    # An approximation of this method could be:
    #
    #   a'  a  1   bc 2           d   3           4
    #   -----[-+-]--[-+--]---------[--+-]------[--+-]-
    #
    # Let's suppose that 1,2,3,4 are the movement counts (+).
    # Their starts and ends are marked by [ and ].
    # First, you define an anchor and a target.
    # The anchor and the target are the indices of movements separated by
    # no more than two movements.
    # From the image above, the first anchor is 1 and the first target is 2.
    # You then calculate the distance (D):
    #   one point before the start of a target (b) - start of an anchor (a)
    # If the anchor is 1, then instead of a, use a'.

    # i. If D > 6000, you increase [time asleep] by D
    #    Then the new anchor will be the previous target (2), and the new
    #    target will be target + 1 (3).
    #    D is newly defined: d-c (refer to the image above)
    #
    # ii. If FALSE, increase the target by 1 and check if the new distance
    #     b' - a' is greater than 6000 (refer to the imave below).
    #     If that's TRUE, do i. and move on.
    #     If that's FALSE, increase the target one more time do the same.
    #     (D = b'' - a'; D > 6000?)
    #
    #   a'  a  1   b  2           b'  3       b'' 4
    #   -----[-+-]--[-+--]---------[--+-]------[--+-]-
    #
    #     If you still see that D = b'' - a' < 6000, increase the anchor
    #     by 1, and repeat ii.
    #     If D > 6000, do i and move on.
